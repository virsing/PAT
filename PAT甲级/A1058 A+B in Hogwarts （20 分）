If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you would know the world of magic has its own currency system -- as Hagrid explained it to Harry, "Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough." Your job is to write a program to compute A+B where A and B are given in the standard form of Galleon.Sickle.Knut (Galleon is an integer in [0,10
​7
​​], Sickle is an integer in [0, 17), and Knut is an integer in [0, 29)).
Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line with A and B in the standard form, separated by one space.
Output Specification:
For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input.
Sample Input:
3.2.1 10.16.27
Sample Output:
14.1.28

#include<cstdio>
struct node{
	int G,S,K;
};
int main()
{
	node a,b,ans;
	scanf("%d.%d.%d",&a.G,&a.S,&a.K);
	scanf("%d.%d.%d",&b.G,&b.S,&b.K);
	int c1=0,c2=0;
	ans.K=(a.K+b.K)%29;
	c1=(a.K+b.K)/29;
	ans.S=(a.S+b.S+c1)%17;
	c2=(a.S+b.S+c1)/17;
	ans.G=a.G+b.G+c2;
	printf("%d.%d.%d\n",ans.G,ans.S,ans.K);
	return 0;
}

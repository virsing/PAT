A supply chain is a network of retailers（零售商）, distributors（经销商）, and suppliers（供应商）-- everyone involved in moving a product from supplier to customer.

Starting from one root supplier, everyone on the chain buys products from one's supplier in a price P and sell or distribute them in a price that is r% higher than P. Only the retailers will face the customers. It is assumed that each member in the supply chain has exactly one supplier except the root supplier, and there is no supply cycle.

Now given a supply chain, you are supposed to tell the lowest price a customer can expect from some retailers.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, The first line contains three positive numbers: N (≤10​5​​), the total number of the members in the supply chain (and hence their ID's are numbered from 0 to N−1, and the root supplier's ID is 0); P, the price given by the root supplier; and r, the percentage rate of price increment for each distributor or retailer. Then N lines follow, each describes a distributor or retailer in the following format:

K​i​​ ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K​i​​]

where in the i-th line, K​i​​ is the total number of distributors or retailers who receive products from supplier i, and is then followed by the ID's of these distributors or retailers. K​j​​ being 0 means that the j-th member is a retailer. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the lowest price we can expect from some retailers, accurate up to 4 decimal places, and the number of retailers that sell at the lowest price. There must be one space between the two numbers. It is guaranteed that the all the prices will not exceed 10​10​​.

Sample Input:

10 1.80 1.003 2 3 51 91 41 702 6 11 8000

Sample Output:

1.8362 2


题意：给出一棵商品销售的供应树形图，一共n个结点，根结点处价格p，每增加一层价格增加r%，让你求出最便宜的销售价格是多少，一共有多少个这种节点。

思路：首先建立树结构，然后设置一个DFS函数每次遍历到叶结点就判断价格是否更低，如果是就保存，并统计个数。

参考代码：
--------------------- 
#include<cstdio>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
const int inf=(1<<30);
int n,num=0;
double p,r,MinPrice=inf;
struct node{
	vector<int> child;
}T[100010];
void DFS(int u,double price){
	if(T[u].child.size()==0){
		if(price<MinPrice){
			MinPrice=price;
			num=1;
		}else if(price==MinPrice)
			num++;
		return;
	}
	for(int i=0;i<T[u].child.size();i++){
		int v=T[u].child[i];
		DFS(v,(1+r/100)*price);
	}
}

int main()
{
	int t,cnt;
	scanf("%d%lf%lf",&n,&p,&r);
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		scanf("%d",&cnt);
		for(int j=0;j<cnt;j++){
			scanf("%d",&t);
			T[i].child.push_back(t);
		}
	}
	DFS(0,p);
	printf("%.4f %d\n",MinPrice,num);
	return 0;
}
